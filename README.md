# California-Housing-Prediction
This is an introductory regression problem that uses California housing data from the 1990 census. There's a description of the original data here, but we're using a slightly altered dataset that's on github (and appears to be mirrored on kaggle). The problem here is to create a model that will predict the median housing value for a census block group (called "district" in the dataset) given the other attributes. The original data is also available from sklearn so I'm going to take advantage of that to get the description and do a double-check of the model.
